# algorithms-search-a-finite-tree

Implement min-max and alpha-beta pruning algorithms for a game tree search.

Utilized the module any tree from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anytree

From the comparison, we can get that with prefect ordering, the alpha-beta pruning can really improve effectiveness ans save time.
